## About Those Six Forbidden Letters - API KEY

Ah yes, API KEY—those six mystical letters that shall not be named. Apple's review guidelines treat them like some forbidden incantation, though they never explicitly said so. Every time we dare mention them in our submission, we get rejected faster than you can say "App Store." After countless hours battling this "sensitive word," we finally learned our lesson: shut up and move on. So we deleted the API KEY input box.

I tried every possible way to communicate and explain. After all, our FlowDown team just wants to build something clean and beautiful—we don't collect or profit from your API KEY. But after months of struggle, we finally got it: silence is golden. So we removed the API KEY input box entirely.

How could our humble little app possibly comprehend those sophisticated in-app purchase systems that big corporations use? We're just too simple-minded to grasp such complexity. That's right, we simply can't learn it. After all, our tiny workshop can't even figure out a basic in-app purchase system for sure. FlowDown TestFlight is completely free, GitHub releases cost nothing, and the code is fully open source.

Honestly, every time I see users asking "where do I put the API Key," I feel utterly helpless. FlowDown isn't designed for people who just want to find an input box and paste their API KEY (if that's you, perhaps you should stick with the official chat apps). You really should first **understand what an API KEY actually is**, then learn **what HTTP request headers are**, and then you'll naturally know **where the API KEY should go**. If you can't manage even these basics, you should find someone to set up [**enterprise configuration**](https://apps.qaq.wiki/docs/flowdown/en/documents/advanced_settings/enterprise.html) for you.

If none of this makes sense to you, well... I suppose there's nothing more I can say. *sigh*
